    <h2>COBOL Transactions:</h2>
    <p>
      This is a COBOL program that I wrote in my Legacy Langauges Computer
      Science class. The assignment was to read from a list of raw numerical
      transactions and to format them neatly, as well as reject and remove
      incorrect or inconsistent data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shown here is the Procedure Division, which is where the already defined
      data is processed. Here, the data is read to ensure that it fits within
      the parameters, and is then moved to the print line. Then, the totals of
      the data are adjusted after each transaction. If the data is inconsistent
      with the parameters, an error message is sent to the print line instead.
      Once all data is processed, termination begins, where the totals are moved
      to the print line and displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visual output is then shown in the terminal window, as displayed here.
      The data neatly lines up, and the lines of rejected data are shown, along
      with a final total of successful transactions, items purchased, and total
      cost of items.

      One problem we were given in Algoritms class was the interval scheduling
      problem, in which we are trying to find an algorithm which, given some
      number of intervals, selects out the highest possible number of intervals
      which can be scheduled within the given range with no overlaps. We tried a
      variety of different ways to schedule the intervals, finding the one that
      consistently gave us the highest count.
    </p>
    <p>
      The given image here shows the correct algorithm applied onto a randomly
      generated set of intervals, with the red bars representing the intervals
      selected by the algorithm.

    <p>
      For my internship, I learned and did some work with PowerBI, Microsoft's
      business intelligence software. I used relational data tables in order to
      build interactive visual dashboards with company data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the main dashboard of a sample project that I built during my
      PowerBI training course. It uses data from an online bicycle store, and
      allows the user to sort the data by category, subcategory, or product, and
      shows sale, regional, and customer trends.
