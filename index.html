      Hello! My name is Omar Alshaali. I'm a Computer Science major in my senior
      year at the University of St. Thomas. I was born and raised in Dubai, in
      the United Arab Emirates. My mother is originally from Bloomington, so
      I've spent a lot of my life back and forth between the two cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I began my college career, I aimed to go major in Mechanical
      Engineering. Yet after my first Introduction to Programming course, I knew
      that I wanted to pursue Computer Science. I find the problem-solving
      nature of the field to be very appealing, and love a good challenge.
      Throughout my undergraduate education thus far, I've had the opportunities
      to learn a variety of programming languages and structures, giving me a
      strong foundational understanding of the field and preparing me for the
      workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that now is a more exciting time to enter the world of Computer
      Science than ever before. With the constant digital evolutions and
      intergration of technology into new aspects of our everyday lives, it
      becomes more and more useful to be able to understand this technological
      space with which we constantly interact. The relevance of artificial
      intelligence, cybersecurity, and cloud computing greatly excites me as I
      eagerly anticipate my opportunity to contribute to the industry.
